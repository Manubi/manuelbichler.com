As the new year has started, I want to share my process to achieve maybe some of my goals. I will try to be as transparent as possible and share my thoughts and ideas. I will also share my failures - probably too many - and what I learned from them.

## Goals

I guess my goals are not so different from anyone else. I want to be happy, I want to be healthy, I want to be successful and I want to be a good person. I want to be a good son, a good brother, a good friend and a good colleague. I want to be a good person in general. I want to be a good person to myself. I imagine with the ripe year of 36 I should be able to make the necessary changes.

These are rather vague goals. I want to be happy, but what does that mean? I want to be healthy, but ...

The main goal is to do a couple experiments, as I think that's the only way to find out what works for me.
So let's have a look at what stuff I believe will help me get there.

### DO's

- meditate 5 times a week (daily checkin inkl. minutes)
- exercise 3 times a week for at least 60 minutes (daily checkin inkl. minutes)
- cold showers - I am already doing this but maybe not 80% of the time (daily checkin)
- eat healthy - i imagine I do that already but I will try to be more conscious about it (daily checkin)
- sleep enough - my hours vary depending on if I worked out or not, but I will try to be in bed by 10pm and read a book (daily checkin - sleep score oura ring)
- be grateful - this should be one of the easier ones as I am already doing it with the meditation thing (daily checkin - 3 items)
- read books 5 times a week - I used to read much more and I will get back to it (daily checkin - minutes)
- write in public - tried it a couple of times. This is difficult for me. But I guess it's as with everything else. Keep trying. (daily checkin, 5 times per week - minutes)
- build a side project that makes money - this is a big one for me. (daily checkin, 5 times per week - minutes)
- learn new stuff - this comes quiet natural for me. I will try to learn more about Rust language and biology. ( not sure if i should track this, as it is a result of the other things I do.)
- participate in a hackathon (yeah I want to do a hackathon again)
- visit a foreign country
- maybe visit a conference
- do a familytrip for a couple days
- do some boxing/mma lessons (at least 3)
- go to a meetup every month (one per month, include text field)
- do some yoga lessons
- learn to do a handstand together with my nephew
- try the blueprint diet for a month
- try the 5am club for a month

My basic idea is to trigger myself at least 5 times per week to do certain things, even when motivation only lasts for two minutes. Some of you might wonder, why I didn't includ dating.
Hopefully dates will happen "organically" :P

### purpose

I want to help reverse engineer the human code. I think it's one of the things that will have a huge impact on our lives.
Everthing from climate, over health, to industry will change radically.

Currently a couple of developments are intersting that I think will help us making the goal of a programmable human a reality. Programmable
might sound dystopian. Maybe it will. But as with every technology it depends on how you'll use it.

- Sequenzing is getting cheaper and cheaper. Meaning we produce more and more data/information.
- AI models are improving at a rapid pace.
- We are getting better at understanding the human body and how it works.

So the plan is to build tools that make the data and information exchange between biology teams and AI teams easier.
I'll write more about the how in a next blog post.

I think we are at the beginning of a new era. An era where we can change the world for the better.

### DON'Ts

- less alcohol & co - again big one for me. (daily checkin - max 2 times per month - which are 24 blackouts which still sounds a lot imho)
- less sugar ( daily checkin 5 times per week)
- less social media especially twitter as I basically don't use anything else (daily checkin only 3 times per week incl. minutes)
- less newsletters and blogs (only 3 times per week including minutes - difficult)

I don't put less screen time here as most of my and learning is done on the screen. What I will try is to put the screens off before 10pm.

To sum it up I think my general goal is to move more towards producing and less towards consuming. Basically reducing the habits of social media and other entertainment for more action oriented stuff.

## Process

I am not the follow this rule 100% kind of guy. I am more the try to follow this rule 80% kind of guy. I will try to follow the process as much as possible, but I will not beat myself up if I don't. So let's see if I can keep the percentage above 80 pecent. I will try to be as transparent as possible and share my thoughts and ideas. That's why I will build a public dashboard where I will track that stuff.
As I think time spend has the most value with the tracking I will track the time spend on the DO's and DON'Ts and publish the results on the dashboard. I will also write weekly updates on my progress.

The list is rather long, but without any time limits, just shots.
So let's see how far I can go and what it feels like.
