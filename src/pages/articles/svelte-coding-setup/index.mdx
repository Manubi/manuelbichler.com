As I recently started developing with Svelte I was looking around how I can make my life easier. This is just a small list of things I think are useful to add to your workflow if you're using Svelte.

## Svelte Extensions for VSCode

You can either have a look at the official VSCode extension for Svelte: [Svelte for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) or just get the bundle of the three most popular extensions [Svelte Bundle](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=1YiB.svelte-bundle). It packs the three most popular Svelte extensions into one.
Gives you syntax highlighting, intellisense, diagnostic messages, formatting, snippets...

## Navigation with Short Labels

Add this line to your user settings in VSCode in order to get the short label in every text file header which allows you to easily see to which folder/route a certain `+page.svelte` or `+page.server.ts` belongs. The setting is `"workbench.editor.labelFormat": "short"`.

<Image src={folderName} alt="folder name" />

## Tree indent

Apply these settings for a cleaner look with custom indentation and color-coded guides:

```
"workbench.tree.renderIndentGuides": "always",
"workbench.tree.indent": 14,
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "tree.indentGuidesStroke": "#2DD4BF"
  }

```

<Image src={indentLine} alt="indent line" />

## Community

### Svelte Discord

Probably the most important thing on the list in my humble opinion. [Discord Server Invite](https://discord.com/invite/svelte) It's the fastest way to troubleshoot or ask for feedback or just hang out and learn.

## News

I like from time to time read about the latest news and I prefer to do that via newsletters.

### Svelte.dev blog

### The (Unofficial) Svelte JS Newsletter

Hope this list helps you a little bit in making your live with svelte even easier.

## Learning
