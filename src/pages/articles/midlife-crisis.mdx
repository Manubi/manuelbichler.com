## A Spoiled Brat's Crisis in the Acidic Age

Here I am, hurtling through my late 30s, baptized in the fire of a midlife crisis riddled with a viral pandemic, a war between Ukraine and Russia, and a slew of personal catastrophes—loved ones enduring strokes, divorce, breakups, and petty brawls. The cosmic joke is on me, exposing the delicate thread that is life, and all the things you can lose in a blink of an eye. It's a sinister revelation, the lack of control you have, just as you're starting to feel like an adult. You know, when the only mail you receive are bills, your company's coffee tastes like rat piss, and hangovers have become a cruel and unusual punishment. This is adulthood, and it's a goddamn hellscape.

Ah, the good old days. "Everything was better back then," they say. It's the sweet memories of your prime, unburdened by the weight of adult responsibilities. There was no bureaucratic bullshit back then, just freedom and mischief.

The latest TikTok filter transported you back to the salad days of late teens and early twenties, leaving people in tears. As a young person, you couldn't possibly fathom the sensation of getting old, but the hourglass has spoken, and now, for the first time, I feel ancient. With age comes expectations: a plan, a respectable job, marriage, children—the societal checklist that haunts us all. But that's not what truly gnaws at me.

What's eating me alive are the expectations I have for myself—becoming a founder, ditching the booze, getting fit, starting a family, planting trees, and settling into a house. Time was once a bottomless pit of opportunity, but now the sand is slipping through my fingers. Mother Nature has a way of sowing seeds of desire into your heart, your mind, or wherever these feelings take root.

This new phase of life is upon me, and I know there are more to come. Remember the transition from teen to young adult? A blast, wasn't it? Hell no. But I'm ready for the next chapter because with each crisis comes a fresh start, new opportunities.

I'm grateful for the luxury of still being able to pursue these dreams, or at least those within my control. But time is running out, a feeling that's entirely foreign to me, and I'm not fond of it. I'm compelled to consider working on age-related solutions, trying to cure the "aging disease." Sure, it might solve some problems and create new ones, but that's a tale for another time.

And then, you hit 40—single, clueless, and feeling left behind. In today's world of social media, where everyone's seemingly more attractive, intelligent, wealthy, and successful, it's a challenge not to feel inadequate.

But beneath the superficial veneer, we all grapple with similar struggles, facing challenges that can't be remedied by money, followers, or likes. It's true that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and without the lows, the highs would lose their allure. The best things in life are worth the wait.

So, as we embark on this wild ride, let's embrace the struggle, revel in the chaos, and remember that love will find us in the end.

## A spoiled brats crisis (version without AI)

I am in my late 30s. I've spend my midlife crisis with corona. A war between ukraine and russia. And then there are the personal things like a stroke of a loved one. A divorce. A break up. Some useless fights.
This all sucks. It plainly shows you how fragile life is. How much you can lose in a short amount of time. It somehow makes you feel like you are not in control. Even though you only
just began feeling like an adult. You know, complaining about that the only letters you get are invoices. How bad the coffee in your company kitchen is. How bad hangovers became. But I imagine this is what it feels like to be an adult. And it fucking sucks.
I guess I finally know what they mean with "In the old days everything was better." It's the memories of yourself in the so called - prime of your life - that makes you feel that way. There was no adult bullshit.

The latest tiktok filter beamed you back to your late teens/early twenties. People started crying. I guess as a fairly young person you don't know the feeling of being old. At least I didn't. But it's here now. I, for the first time in my life feel old.
And this comes hand in hand with expectations. You need to have a plan. You need to have a job that is valued by society. You need to have blablabla. You know, all the stuff that people expect from you.
You should be married. You should have kids. You should... should... should. But that's not the thing that bothers me that much.

The thing that bothers me, is the stuff that I expect from myself. Things such as becoming a founder.
Quitting alcohol. Becoming fit again. Or starting a family. Plant a tree. Move in a house. You know that kind of stuff...
It always seemed there is so much time to fuck around. But time becomes more precious day by day.
You finally want stuff that was a couple years ago far far away. I guess mother nature finds it's way and plants the seeds in your heart, mind or wherever you think this stuff shows up.

Sounds and feels like a new life phase to me. And as we all know we have a couple of them. I mean rember your transition from teenager to early adulthood. Was that fun? No.
But I am looking forward to my next phase. Because with every crisis there comes new opporunities.

I feel blessed that I have the luxury to still have the possibility to do all these things. At least those that are in my control. But I also feel like I am running out of time. Which is a weird feeling.
A feeling I had never before in my life. And I don't like it. But I will learn to deal with it. Makes me think about working in ageing and help solving the "aging disease".
Some of the problems would be surley solved by that. Some new ones would arise. But that's for another time.

And then you are 40 and you are still single. Have no clue what to do with your life. And you feel like the world moved on without you.
I think in todays world with all this social media crap, where everyone is prettier, smarter, richer, more successful, more whatever... it's hard to feel like you are good enough.

But I think everyone knows that this is bullshit. We finally have to struggle with similar things. Things that can't be fixed with $. Or followers. Or likes.

I believe, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Without downs there aren't any ups. And the good stuff is worth the wait.

So keep struggling and enjoy the fuckin ride. There will be stories to tell. Love will find you!
