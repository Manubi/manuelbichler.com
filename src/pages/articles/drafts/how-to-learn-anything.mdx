## The whole game

start by experiencing the whole thing. no one would come to the idea to start learning skiing by studying about the theory of skiing. get into the fucking game. you only get better by practising. you'll get a feel on how to play the game. you'll learn the details later on when you've learned how to walk.

## try to use methapors

metaphors not only help you to remember things easier, but they also help you to understand things better. they help you to understand the underlying concepts. they help you to understand the big picture. they help you to understand the whole thing.

## simplicity

I know, by now everyone is already bored and knows how important simplicity is. But the problem is most things in life are neither simple nor easy. But you need to be ably to simplify in order to get it.

## remove barriers

this is closley related to building habbits. you need to remove the barriers to get started as easy as possible. put the book beside your bed. do a meditation the first thing in the morning. print out code for reading at night. put on your headphones and start.
there will be times where the journey get's hard. don't give up. giving up is the only thing that makes you fail. you can't fail if you don't give up. the excuse many people including myself often come up with is, it's not for me. I am not interested anymore.
this is mostly just excuse bullshit. after you've gone threw the valley of death a couple times, you know that you can do it. and you also know that a new world waits after it. so stick with it for a couple of weeks more.

a couple of weeks are nothing in the grand scheme of life, but in many learning journeys it's the difference between success and failure.
and by the way getting unstuck wasn ever easier then nowadays. use new tools to like chatgpt, use forums to ask other more experienced people, hang out on discord. there are so many ways to get unstuck. don't give up.

## have a goal

goals are imporant but discipline and systems are what take you there. For example my goal when learning about AI and neural networks was to build a neural network that can identify every dog nose. I had no idea how to do it. I had no idea what a neural network is. I had no idea what a dog nose is, this i actually did know. I also knew dog noses are the dogs counterparts to human fingerprints. They are unique.
why dognoses? because i want to build a register where you can register your dog with his nose and safe it on the blockchain. you would create and nft that basicially shows the whole world who this dog belongs to. so if your dog would get lost or stolen, you just need to scant he nose to find out where it belongs to.
so my goal is to bring dognoses on the blockchain.

## learn step wise in small increments

meaning eg. if you want to learn vim just start easy. as soon as you feeel okay how could I do this with vim, just look up a command.
learning one command every other day isn't that difficult. It's probably not the fastest way to learn, but for me it's a sure way to improve. Like get better 1% every day.
