# Drugs

“I have absolutely no pleasure in the stimulants in which I sometimes so madly indulge. It has not been in the pursuit of pleasure that I have periled life and reputation and reason. It has been the desperate attempt to escape from torturing memories, from a sense of insupportable loneliness and a dread of some strange impending doom.” - Edgar Allan Poe

outline:

- go into the history of drugs. write about how cleopatra and the greeks used it.
- speak about your own experience with drugs. Talk about how you where afraid of drugs as a teenager growing up in the mountains.
  paint it as the devil.
- speak about how you where introduced to drugs. By a best friend. And you where sober and did expect something totally different.
- speak about how this experience becaume normal. How i got introduced to other drugs. How I basically missused drugs for a long time.
- how at my age it feels like drugs are just a time killer. Not that many enjoy it anymore. It's a way to escape reality.
- i like the feeling of drugs. I like the feeling of being high. What i don't like is the blackouts I get from alchol.
- drugs are nice if your happy. they suck when you feel down.
