# No love

why i think the idea of a life partner only makes sense if you start out without being in love.
how it normaly happens is you fall in love. love goes away. you struggle to keep a partnership working. you either get married, make some kids. or your break up.
during the first months normally between 24-36 months you're in love and your brain looks the same as if you're on cocaine.
which evolutionary makes quiet sense, as after 3 years your better half should have a kid and you should be able to support them.
evolutionary you're also not supposed to be in love for more than 3 years, as you're supposed to find a new partner and have kids with them.
you know... survival of the fittest. I mean you also could argue that some are supposed to do it like the kukuk but that's not really how it works in our society.
especially with all the tests around fatherhood. anyway, back to the topic. Why I think a marriage could possibly work out better without being in love.
first, without the love at the beginning your brain isn't like that of an addict. which allows you to make better decision that are not solely focused on desire and sex.
second, if you can make it threw a couple of years without love at the beginning the chances are high that something works. something works really good.
I know this idea will be taken badly, as it takes away a lot of romance. But I think the opposite is the case. I think maybe true love is only attainable after the honey moon is gone.
But what I also know, it's probably not possible. Because if you don't love someone at the beginning, but you really like someone, mother nature changes the liking to love and your brain
doesn't stop thinking about this person. like she's the one. I can't live without her. Then you start a relationship, wander on cloud 7 and have a couple of the best years you have in life.
maybe it's more like carpe diem. take as much highs as you can get. because life is shitty enough already. So one might argue, why settle for the boring stable relationship? I honestly don't know,
I also not one of these people who know like form the age of 9 that they become a doctor. Find their better half at the age of 19 and merry at the age of 24. Get kids at 27... you know the drill.
Nothing bad with that. But what happens with all the people who are not that lucky?
