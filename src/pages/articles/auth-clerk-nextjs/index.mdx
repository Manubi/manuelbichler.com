When I started out as a dev, authentication always felt a little bit intimidating. So many new concepts to learn, so many new libraries to install, so many new things to configure. And there is the angst of implementing an unsecure system. Just to finally end up with a system that allows users to login. It was a pain.

Don't get me wrong, struggling is good. It's how we learn. And there is definitely a benefit if you've implemented authentication a couple of times from scratch.
But roling your own authentication comes with a downside. You have to maintain it. And if you're like me, you'll probably have more interesting problems to solve then keeping your authentication system up to date.
So as I said, if you're interested how stuff works, do it yourself. But trust me, it will become a pain in the ass, especially if you're working on more projects.
Anyway, let's dive in. By the way, all the code can be found [here](https://github.com/Manubi/manuelbichler). It's this page.

## Tech stack

- Next.js
- trcp.io
- Clerk.dev

## Setting things up

Im not gonna write about setting up Next.js nor trcp. This is only about adding authentication with Clerk.dev.
The basic workflow is.

1. Register at Clerk.dev and install `npm i @clerk/nextjs`
2. Add AuthProvider with public and protected pages
3. Add Sign-in and Sign-out buttons/components
4. Add middleware to use auth in trcp
5. Add add auth to trpc
6. Protect your routers/procedures with auth
7. Add another field to JWT token
8. Add a webhook to update your database when user details change
9. Time to be 'Happy, peppy and cheerful' ðŸŽ‰

## 1. Register at Clerk.dev and install package

Go to Clerk.dev/register, install the package `npm i @clerk/nextjs` and copy your api keys in your `.env.local` file.

## 2. Add AuthProvider with public and protected routes

As with almost everything in React that you'll need in your whole app, needs to be a context provider.
It's basically your parent giving information to all children which are your Components. First I'll give you the basic version of the `_app.tsx`. The second version will be a little more realistic.

```typescript
// src/pages/_app.tsx
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ClerkProvider>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

This gives you access to the Clerk context in all your components. But you still need to add the sign-in and sign-out buttons/pages. And you need to tell Clerk which pages are public and which are protected. For this you have two possibilities.
The first one is the following, where you check in your `_app` Component if the page is public or not. This is recommended if you're not using nexts `/pages/api` routes as a backend.

```typescript
// src/pages/_app.ts
import {
  ClerkProvider,
  SignedIn,
  SignedOut,
  RedirectToSignIn,
} from '@clerk/nextjs'
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

//  List pages you want to be publicly accessible, or leave empty if
//  every page requires authentication. Use this naming strategy:
//   "/"              for pages/index.js
//   "/foo"           for pages/foo/index.js
//   "/foo*"          for all the pages inside /foo

const publicPages = []

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  // Get the pathname
  const { pathname } = useRouter()

  // Check if the current route matches a public page
  const isPublicPage = publicPages.includes(pathname)

  // If the current route is listed as public, render it directly
  // Otherwise, use Clerk to require authentication
  return (
    <ClerkProvider
      appearance={{
        variables: { colorPrimary: '#27272A' },
        elements: {
          formFieldInput: 'rounded-md border border-zinc-900/10 bg-white',
        },
      }}
      {...pageProps}
    >
      {isPublicPage ? (
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      ) : (
        <>
          <SignedIn>
            <Component {...pageProps} />
          </SignedIn>
          <SignedOut>
            <RedirectToSignIn />
          </SignedOut>
        </>
      )}
    </ClerkProvider>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

If youre like me and you're using trpc, it's easier to just add a middleware and check if a requested route is public or not.
Also I changed from checking for public routes to private routes as I have only two private routes.

```typescript
// src/middleware.ts
import { getAuth, withClerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

// Set the paths that require the user to be signed in
// get the values of the path property from the routes object of all the protected routes
const privatePaths = Object.values(routes.protected).map((obj) => obj.add.path)
// Ends up in this place as `['/dashboard/add, '/flashcards/add']`
// if you want to white/blacklist a route with all it's children use `*` as a wildcard eg. `/dashboard*`
// no / before the *.
const isPrivate = (path: string) => {
  return privatePaths.find((x) =>
    path.match(new RegExp(`^${x}$`.replace('*$', '($|/)')))
  )
}

export default withClerkMiddleware((request: NextRequest) => {
  if (!isPrivate(request.nextUrl.pathname)) {
    return NextResponse.next()
  }
  // if the user is not signed in redirect them to the sign in page.
  const { userId } = getAuth(request)

  if (!userId) {
    // redirect the users to /pages/sign-in/[[...index]].ts

    const signInUrl = new URL('/sign-in', request.url)
    signInUrl.searchParams.set('redirect_url', request.url)
    return NextResponse.redirect(signInUrl)
  }
  return NextResponse.next()
})
// Stop Middleware running on static files
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    /*
     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
     * - _next
     * - static (static files)
     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)
     * - image (image files)
     */
    '/(.*?trpc.*?|(?!static|.*\\..*|_next?|image|favicon.ico).*)',
  ],
}
```

Now that you have the middleware checking the routes that should be protected, we can continue with adding protection to our trcp handlers.
Let's add auth to our context so we can easily access it in our endpoints.

```typescript
// src/server/context.ts
import type {
  SignedInAuthObject,
  SignedOutAuthObject,
} from '@clerk/nextjs/dist/api'
import { getAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
import * as trpc from '@trpc/server'
import * as trpcNext from '@trpc/server/adapters/next'

interface AuthContext {
  auth: SignedInAuthObject | SignedOutAuthObject
}

/**
 * Inner function for `createContext` where we create the context.
 * This is useful for testing when we don't want to mock Next.js' request/response
 */
export async function createContextInner({ auth }: AuthContext) {
  return { auth }
}

export type Context = trpc.inferAsyncReturnType<typeof createContextInner>

/**
 * Creates context for an incoming request
 * @link https://trpc.io/docs/context
 */
export async function createContext(
  opts: trpcNext.CreateNextContextOptions
): Promise<Context> {
  // for API-response caching see https://trpc.io/docs/caching

  return await createContextInner({ auth: getAuth(opts.req) })
}
```

As we have now access to our context, we can add add middleware to our trcp endpoints. Here we will check if the user is signed in and if not we will throw an error.

```typescript
// src/server/trpc.ts
// check if the user is signed in, otherwise through a UNAUTHORIZED CODE
const isAuthed = t.middleware(({ next, ctx }) => {
  if (!ctx.auth.userId) {
    throw new TRPCError({ code: 'UNAUTHORIZED' })
  }
  return next({
    ctx: {
      auth: ctx.auth,
    },
  })
})

export const protectedProcedure = t.procedure.use(isAuthed)
```

What this allows us is to just use the new added middleware/procedure in our endpoint.

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod'
import { prisma } from '../prisma'
import { protectedProcedure, publicProcedure, router } from '../trcp'

export const guestbookRouter = router({
  list: publicProcedure.query(async () => {
    /**
     * For pagination docs you can have a look here
     * @see https://trpc.io/docs/useInfiniteQuery
     * @see https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/pagination
     */

    const messages = await prisma.guestbook.findMany({
      include: { user: true },
      orderBy: {
        createdAt: 'desc',
      },
    })

    return {
      messages,
    }
  }),
  // the added middleware `protectedProcedure` will check if the user is signed in if not it will throw an error.
  add: protectedProcedure
    .input(
      z.object({
        email: z.string().email(),
        name: z.string().min(2),
        message: z.string().min(2),
      })
    )
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      const newInput = {
        userId: ctx.auth.userId,
        email: input.email,
        name: input.name,
        message: input.message,
      }
      const message = await prisma.guestbook.create({
        data: newInput,
      })
      return message
    }),
})
```

Now we have kind of a working authentication system running. For convenience reasons we will add two things. First, add a webhook to keep clerk and our database in sync.
Webhooks are how services notify each other of events. Basically just ah `POST` request with some payload that goes to an pre-determined endpoint.
Second update the JWT and session claims to add fields to our auth/session tokens.

For adding a webhook go to the Clark dashboard and click on the `Webhooks` link. Add a new webhook and select the `User Signed In` event.
Then add the url to your backend. In our case it is `https://api.yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/clerk/user-signed-in`.

Because webhooks can be easily missused we add a library caled svix for verifying the webhook. You can read more on their [documentation](https://docs.svix.com/).
For local debugging I also recommend to install their [CLI](https://docs.svix.com/tutorials/cli).

Second thing is we will update the JWT token details to include not only the `userId` but in our case also the `email`, `firstName`, `lastName` and `web3Wallets`.
These are called claims. You also can add such claims for other third party services like stripe or github if you want to interact with those.
Just go to your clerk dashboard and click on the `JWT Templates` link. Add the details as in the image or read up on the stuff in the right bottom corner.

<Image src={jwt} alt="clerk custom jwt" />

Now the email, firstName,... are added to your JWT. And can be easily accessed via your `useUser` hook.

```typescript
import { useUser } from '@clerk/nextjs'
export default function Index() {
  const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, user } = useUser()
  console.log('user', user)
  //todo manuel add the return of the user




```

Same for the backend. You need to update the session to include the claims and can access them with the `getAuth` function or via the context.
// todo manuel add the web3wallets and add the image of the sessions in the clerk dashbaord

````typescript
