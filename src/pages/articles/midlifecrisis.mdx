# A spoiled brats crisis

I am in my late 30s. I've spend my midlife crisis with corona. A war between ukraine and russia. And then there are the personal things like a stroke of a loved one. A divorce. A break up. Some useless fights.
This all sucks. It plainly shows you how fragile life is. How much you can lose in a short amount of time. It somehow makes you feel like you are not in control. Even though you only
just began feeling like an adult. You know, complaining about that the only letters you get are invoices. How bad the coffee in your company kitchen is. How bad hangovers became. But I imagine this is what it feels like to be an adult. And it fucking sucks.
I guess I finally know what they mean with "In the old days everything was better." It's the memories of yourself in the so called - prime of your life - that makes you feel that way. There was no adult bullshit.

The latest tiktok filter beamed you back to your late teens/early twenties. People started crying. I guess as a fairly young person you don't know the feeling of being old. At least I didn't. But it's here now. I, for the first time in my life feel old.
And this comes hand in hand with expectations. You need to have a plan. You need to have a job that is valued by society. You need to have blablabla. You know, all the stuff that people expect from you.
You should be married. You should have kids. You should... should... should. But that's not the thing that bothers me that much.

The thing that bothers me, is the stuff that I expect from myself. Things such as becoming a founder.
Quitting alcohol. Becoming fit again. Or starting a family. Plant a tree. Move in a house. You know that kind of stuff...
It always seemed there is so much time to fuck around. But time becomes more precious day by day.
You finally want stuff that was a couple years ago far far away. I guess mother nature finds it's way and plants the seeds in your heart, mind or wherever you think this stuff shows up.

Sounds and feels like a new life phase to me. And as we all know we have a couple of them. I mean rember your transition from teenager to early adulthood. Was that fun? No.
But I am looking forward to my next phase. Because with every crisis there comes new opporunities.

I feel blessed that I have the luxury to still have the possibility to do all these things. At least those that are in my control. But I also feel like I am running out of time. Which is a weird feeling.
A feeling I had never before in my life. And I don't like it. But I will learn to deal with it. Makes me think about working in ageing and help solving the "aging disease".
Some of the problems would be surley solved by that. Some new ones would arise. But that's for another time.

And then you are 40 and you are still single. Have no clue what to do with your life. And you feel like the world moved on without you.
I think in todays world with all this social media crap, where everyone is prettier, smarter, richer, more successful, more whatever... it's hard to feel like you are good enough.

But I think everyone knows that this is bullshit. We finally have to struggle with similar things. Things that can't be fixed with $. Or followers. Or likes.

I believe, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Without downs there aren't any ups. And the good stuff is worth the wait.

So keep struggling and enjoy the fuckin ride. There will be stories to tell. Love will find you!
