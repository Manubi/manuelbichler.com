In today's world, we're often sold the idea that instant gratification is synonymous with success. However, my experience tells a different story. Much of what I've learned as an adult resulted from enduring challenges and tackling concepts that initially seemed insurmountable. Like how water shapes stones over time, the human mind, too, adapts and learns, gradually overcoming obstacles. Consistent, day-by-day effort eventually demystifies new interests. Indeed, it appears that truly understanding something worthwhile takes about a year.

## Slow is smooth and smooth is fast

Adult learning is a test of perseverance. Unlike in our younger years, when progress seemed more direct, acquiring new skills now requires patience and sustained effort. The journey involves daily dedication, often extending over months or even years. The easy pickings are gone; what's left demands more of us, challenging us to dig deeper.

## Commitment is all it takes

Reflecting on my own journey, the pivotal moment came in 2017 when I decided to learn programming. That year was transformative. It was filled with days dedicated to understanding the workings of computers. Sure, there were moments of frustration, like when a day was lost searching for a misplaced semicolon, leading me to question my choices. Yet, that year reshaped my career and me profoundly. It proved I could master almost anything independently, without seeking validation for my intelligence.

2024 promises to be another challenging year. It'll be slow and sometimes arduous, but I anticipate finding joy in the challenge and emerging more fulfilled. After all, the highs wouldn't feel as sweet without the lows.
